Data used in a following analysis is a historical collection of crime incidents that happened from 2003 to May 2018 in San Francisco. The dataset is provided by City and County of San Francisco and can be accessed [here](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-Historical-2003/tmnf-yvry/about_data). It includes information about incidents' types (with 37 unique types in total), location (including address as well as longitude and latitude), and time of occurrence (including date, time and day of week). Since we don't have full set of data from 2018, we decided to discard this year in our analyses and focus on years 2003-2017.
